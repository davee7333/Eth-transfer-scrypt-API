To transfer Ethereum (ETH) using API keys, you can use a cryptocurrency exchange API or a blockchain node API. However, it's important to note that transferring ETH using API keys requires access to your wallet's private key, which should be handled securely and kept confidential.

For demonstration purposes, I'll show you how to use the Infura API, which is a popular Ethereum node service, to transfer ETH from one address to another. To use Infura, you need to sign up for a free account and obtain an API key.

Install the required libraries:
bash
pip install web3
Now, here's a Python script to transfer ETH using the Infura API:
scrypt.py
